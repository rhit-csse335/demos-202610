Prompt: 
```
I want to make a simple C demo using openMPI that illustrates deadlock. I'd like a MWE of a single program running on two nodes with MPI_Send and MPI_Recv that looks like it's doing something reasonable but will actually deadlock every time. We'll run on an OpenPVS cluster, so also include a jobfile. ```

## Overview

Demonstrate MPI Deadlock with two nodes. Submit the job, wait for it to time out, and explain what happened.

## The Fix:

Edit `deadlock_demo.c` so that one node sends before receiving, and the other node receives before sending.
