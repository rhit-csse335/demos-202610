# Vizualization of Amdahl's Law

This is a Python script that makes an interactive visualization. You won't be able to run this on grendel unless you've done some very fancy work to set up tunneled graphics. Instead, you would run this file locally on your own device. The script depends on two standard Python libraries: `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.
